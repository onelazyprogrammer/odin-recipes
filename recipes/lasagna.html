    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>We used to eat lasagna with my friends, back in Paraguay. This became specially frecuent after Kira's father's birthday.
        After that day, we would always eat lasagna together under the excuse that "It was a family dinner". Little did we know, we actually were a family, 
        in some way...
